# Pihole

## Objective

>To deploy and configure Pi-hole as a network-wide ad blocker and DNS server, providing enhanced privacy, reduced network load, and faster browsing by blocking unwanted ads, trackers, and malicious domains at the DNS level. This project demonstrates core skills in server management, network configuration, and basic security hardening, making it a foundational step in building a secure home lab environment.

### Skills Learned

>Network-wide Ad Blocking: Installed and configured Pi-hole as a DNS server to block ads and trackers across all devices on the network.

>Custom DNS Server Setup: Deployed a local DNS server for faster, more private domain resolution.

>DHCP Server Configuration: Replaced routerâ€™s DHCP server with Pi-hole for better network control and device management.

>Firewall Hardening: Configured UFW and iptables to secure the server from unauthorized access.

>SSH Key Authentication: Secured remote server access using key-based authentication.

>Log Monitoring and Analysis: Implemented logging and query analytics for network traffic insights.

>Linux Server Administration: Managed software updates, user permissions, and system security on a self-hosted server.

### Tools Used

>Raspberry Pi OS Lite: Operating system for hosting the Pi-hole instance.

>UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall): Firewall for securing the server.

>Fail2Ban: Brute-force protection for SSH and other services.

>SSH (OpenSSH): Secure remote server management.

>Bash: Command-line scripting for server management and automation.
